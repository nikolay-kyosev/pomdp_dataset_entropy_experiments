# Experiments for the Master's Thesis:  
**"Generating Diverse Datasets in Partially Observable Environments"**

To set up and run this project, follow these steps:

---

## 1. Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 2. Run main.py
```bash
python main.py
```

## 3. Wait for the results
The tables are printed in the terminal window.

## Notes
- The experiments are split into three categories: **Runtime**, **Exact algorithm comparison**, **Large dataset comparison**

- On my setup, executing all experiments takes approximately 45â€“60 minutes.

- The runtime experiment results may differ depending on the computer being used.

- Resulting plots are saved in the plots/ directory.
